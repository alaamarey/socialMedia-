üì∞ Building a Modern Social Media Application with Angular 20
üß© Overview
---
In this project, I developed a fully functional Social Media Application using the latest features of Angular 20, leveraging Signals for reactive state management and enhancing user experience with tools like SweetAlert2, ngx-toastr, and ngx-pagination.
The project follows a modular, scalable architecture and applies advanced Angular concepts such as Guards, Resolver Guards, Injection Tokens, and lazy routing for performance optimization.

üöÄ Key Features

üß† 1. Signals for Reactive State

Instead of relying solely on RxJS or Services with BehaviorSubject, the project uses Angular Signals to manage post state:
``bash 
        posts = signal<Post[]>([]);
         addPost(newPost: Post) {
               this.posts.update((current) => [newPost, ...current]);
              }
