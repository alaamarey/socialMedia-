üì∞ Building a Modern Social Media Application with Angular 20
üß© Overview

In this project, I developed a fully functional Social Media Application using the latest features of Angular 20, leveraging Signals for reactive state management and enhancing user experience with tools like SweetAlert2, ngx-toastr, and ngx-pagination.
The project follows a modular, scalable architecture and applies advanced Angular concepts such as Guards, Resolver Guards, Injection Tokens, and lazy routing for performance optimization.
